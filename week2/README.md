# Week 2
The week 2 tutorial for the Fall 2018 CSC411/CSC2515 (Introduction to Machine Learning) at the University of Toronto.

## Getting Started

This week consists of a lecture using both a set of slides with an instructor run jupyter notebook, followed by an exercise for the students.
 
First, present the slides `linear_algebra_goodfellow.pdf`.  The slides are located [here](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/slides/02_linear_algebra.pdf).
This should take about 25 minutes

Second, present the jupyter notebook `CSC411_Fall_2018_Tutorial1_lecture.ipynb`.
Jupyter notebooks can be launched with `jupyter notebook` within a python environment.
<b>Please verify that you have numpy in your python environment and can run the `.ipynb`!</b>
This should take about 20 minutes.

Finally, present the exercise `CSC411_Fall_2018_Tutorial1_worksheet.ipynb`.
To do this, present each problem (in the documentation for each function) to the class.
Ask the class to take a minute to implement the problem without using numpy and with numpy.
Run both the non-vectorized and vectorized examples from `CSC411_Fall_2018_Tutorial1_worksheet.ipynb` to illustrate the speed differences.
This should take about 15 minutes
