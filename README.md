# CSC411/CSC2515 Fall 2018 Tutorials
A collection tutorial materials for the Fall 2018 CSC411/CSC2515 (Introduction to Machine Learning) at the University of Toronto.
The files are organized into subdirectories by the week they were presented.
Most development is done with python 3.7.

## Getting Started

Each week's subdirectory contains a mixture of `.pdf`, `.py`, and `.ipynb` files. 
Additionally, there may be the file used to generate the `.pdf` which can be a `.pptx`, `.key`, or `.tex`.

Currently, the only requirements for running any `.py` or `.ipynb` is numpy.
Constructing a python 3.6+ environment is highly recommended.
This can be easily set up with conda - for example:
```
conda create --name py37 python=3.7
```
A conda cheat-sheet is located [here](https://conda.io/docs/_downloads/conda-cheatsheet.pdf).
The requirements can be installed with python's package manager, `pip`, or `conda`.
For example, inside your python environment with pip:
```
pip install numpy
```

Each week contains a `README` with guidance on how to present the material to the class.
